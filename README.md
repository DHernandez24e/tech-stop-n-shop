  ## Description
  An e-commerce website for tech items for users to browse and purchase. Manager's of the site can also update inventory and items sold, which reflects profit for the Tech Stop-N-Shop company. Using the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime environment, this was built with [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) for the models, [Handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/) for the views, and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for the controllers. Application uses [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/) for user authentication, [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) for password hashing, and a [front-end dark mode switch](https://github.com/coliff/dark-mode-switch) for UX.
